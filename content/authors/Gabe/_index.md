I have had a growing interest in bioinformatics and data science over the last several years. What started out as an effort to expand my scientific toolbox turned into a passion for programming and predictive modeling that has transformed my skill set and professional goals. I enjoy the challenge of drawing insight from all types of data. Each step of the process, from data cleaning and exploration to creating models, deriving predictions and communicating results, is a blend of art and science. Finding that blend, deriving insight and creating value is what drives my passion as a data scientist.
